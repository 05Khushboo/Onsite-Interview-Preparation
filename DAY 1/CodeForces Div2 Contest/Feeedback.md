Hello Everyone,

Right Now, I'm only trying to solve A, B, C & D problems of Div2 Contests. I didn't perform well in this contest. All the 4 problems of this contest are really easy but I made so many wrong submissions and also took so much time to solve the problems. My speed is really slow and also My accuracy is really bad. Basically, I am doing these Div2 contests to improve my speed and accuracy. I think my speed and accuracy will improve after doing these contests.
